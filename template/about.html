                    <h1>About Trinity</h1>
                <h5>A small, distinctive college at the heart of a great university, Trinity College offers an exceptional academic experience and fosters community, responsibility and leadership.</h5>
<p>Founded in 1851, Trinity College in {{site.country}}is the smallest and one of the most prestigious colleges on the St. George Campus at the University of Toronto. The College has over 1,800 undergraduate students who are enrolled in the university’s Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, and about 140 students in Trinity’s Faculty of Divinity, Canada’s oldest Anglican theological school. Trinity offers an exceptional academic experience and is an innovator in interdisciplinary study in areas such as <a href="/study-arts-science/ethics-society-law/">ethics, society &amp; law</a>, <a href="/study-arts-science/immunology/">immunology</a>, <a href="/study-arts-science/international-relations/">international relations</a>&nbsp;and <a href="/study-theology/">theology</a>.</p>
<p>Trinity is a place where leaders come to learn and seek ways to make an impact on the community and the world. Our students are known to be academically excellent and publicly spirited. They are motivated, inquisitive and enjoy a challenge.</p>
<p>As a community, we value the importance of an outstanding education in an environment that encourages individuality, creativity and intellectual dialogue. We champion inclusion, believe in contribution and nurture a feeling of belonging that results in a vibrant energy within our close-knit community.</p>
<p>We are committed to helping the whole student achieve full potential. At the heart of everything we do, our focus remains steadfast – we want to ensure our students have the best experience possible. Our dedicated staff, incredible library and facilities, and integrated student services support students along their journey. Trinity faculty members are among the University of Toronto’s most distinguished and are highly involved in student life. Our communal nature and small size afford unparalleled opportunities to learn and grow both inside and outside the classroom. More than half of Trinity students graduate with distinction or high distinction, and go on to professional and graduate programs throughout the world. The College also has a proud record of producing an unusually large number of Rhodes scholars.</p>
<p>Among our graduates are Jim Balsillie, Adrienne Clarkson, Atom Egoyan<strong>, </strong>Malcolm Gladwell, William C. Graham, Andrew Hutchinson, Craig Kielburger, Kenneth Oppel, Michael Peers, Ted Rogers and John Tory. Those who have taught here include Robertson Davies and Margaret MacMillan, the College’s former Provost.</p>
<p>We are cutting-edge intellectually, but we have a proud and storied past and a set of unique traditions. These traditions bring a sense of community, of shared experience and a way to connect with one another. The beauty of Trinity’s historic buildings also speak to the legacy of the institution and the pride our community has in its heritage.</p>
